Android applications can be integrated with the VMware Workspace ONEÂ® platform, by using its mobile software development kit. The Workspace ONE Integration Guide for Android is a set of documents that contain instructions for integration. This repository holds the code that is included in the guide documents.

The code is organised as a project that can be built, for example with an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Android Studio.

## Agreement

Before downloading, installing or using the VMware Workspace ONE SDK you must:

- Review the [VMware Workspace ONE Software Development Kit License Agreement](https://developer.vmware.com/docs/12215/WorkspaceONE_SDKLicenseAgreement.pdf). By downloading, installing, or using the VMware Workspace ONE SDK you agree to these license terms. If you disagree with any of the terms, then do not use the software.

- Review the [VMware Privacy Notice](https://www.vmware.com/help/privacy.html) and the [Workspace ONE UEM Privacy Disclosure](https://www.vmware.com/help/privacy/uem-privacy-disclosure.html), for information on applicable privacy policies.

That applies however you obtain or integrate the software.
